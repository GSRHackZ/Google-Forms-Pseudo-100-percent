<h3>Keypoints</h3>
<ul style="margin-bottom:10px;">
<li>Works only if teacher allows you to view score and answers at the end of assignment. 💁‍♂️</li><br>
<li>Only works for short response answers at the moment, multiple choice in progress. 🔃</li><br>
<li>Changes all incorrect answers to the correct answers, and changes all things that show it's incorrect to correct. ✅</li><br>
<li>I don't recommend you use this tool a lot for two reasons. One is, you should do your work honestly for your own good. the second is, the teacher will get sus if you keep saying that something is wrong on their end. 💀</li><br>
<li>Do not rely on this tool at all, it's just for fun!! 🤦‍♂️</li><br>
<li>You can not hold me liable for your actions. This tool is for educational purposes only. You have been warned !! ⚠</li><br>
<li>This is still a work in progress, it's good and functional but it may still need some work. If you have any issues please contact me asap. 🙏</li><br>
